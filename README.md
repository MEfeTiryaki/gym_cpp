# gym_cpp
Python is great for testing idea, but in real world robotics is done in Cpp.   
The purpose of this repo is to create playground for cpp implementations of
reinforcement learning algorithms. Environments includes some of the environments in [http://gym.openai.com/docs/](aopenai gym) as it is and some additional environments.
In order to unleash full power of Cpp, the environments are also implemented using
Cpu parallelization.


Move will come soon.
